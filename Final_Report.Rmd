**Project Name:** *Exploring NYC Shooting Data*

**Project Members:** Chenhui Yan (cy2772), Zhaokun Lin (zl3544), Mingyin Wang (aw3693), Zebang Zhang (zz3309)

## Topic

In this exploratory study, we aim to analyze the geographic and temporal distribution of shootings in New York City, with an emphasis on how socioeconomic factors influence these patterns.

## Motivation

Understanding the dynamics of shooting incidents in New York City is crucial for enhancing public safety and fostering resilient communities. By examining demographic patterns in shooting crime data alongside datasets on high school graduation rates and poverty levels, our project aims to identify the socioeconomic factors that influence gun violence. Analyzing how disparities in education and income relate to shooting incidents provides valuable insights for targeted interventions.

## Introduction

Gun violence is a significant public health and social issue New York City, where diverse communities and complex socioeconomic conditions create a unique landscape for understanding its contributing factors. This project examines the geographic, temporal, and socioeconomic patterns of shootings in NYC to identify critical influences on gun violence. We explore how shooting incidents are distributed across boroughs and neighborhoods and examine temporal trends, such as seasonal, monthly, and time-of-day variations. Additionally, we investigate the relationship between education and gun violence, focusing on whether lower high school graduation rates correlate with higher shooting prevalence. Finally, we analyze the connection between poverty and gun violence to determine if neighborhoods with higher poverty levels experience increased incidents of shootings.

## Significance

This research will aid in informing targeted public health and safety interventions by identifying the communities most impacted by shootings. Understanding these patterns will enable policymakers to implement more effective violence prevention measures and allocate resources where they are needed the most.

## Research Questions

Our project focuses on examining the socioeconomic and temporal factors that influence gun violence in New York City. Specifically, we aim to answer the following questions:

 **Geographic and Temporal Patterns of Shootings in NYC**:
   - How are shooting incidents distributed geographically across different boroughs and neighborhoods in New York City?
   - What are the temporal patterns of shootings (e.g., month, season, time of day) in different areas of NYC?

 **Education and Gun Violence**:
   - Is there an association between high school graduation rates and the prevalence of shootings across NYC neighborhoods?
   - Are neighborhoods with lower high school graduation rates more likely to experience higher rates of gun violence?

 **Poverty and Gun Violence**:
   - How does the percentage of people living below the poverty line relate to shooting incidents across neighborhoods in NYC?
   - Are higher poverty levels associated with an increased frequency of shootings?



## Data source

### Original data

This report analyzes shooting incidents in NYC. You can find the original data before merging [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8/about_data). This data is from NYCOpenData, consists some basic information: occur time, coordinate of each incident, victim's information, .etc. 

### data for additional information

* NTA shape data

Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) are medium-sized statistical geographies for reporting Decennial Census and American Community Survey. NTAs were delineated with the need for both geographic specificity and statistical reliability in mind. Shapefile of NTA is get from NYC Planning website, you can find the data [here](https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/census-download-metadata.page), or you can [download](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/dcp/assets/files/zip/data-tools/bytes/nynta2020_24d.zip)

* CDTA data

The Department of City Planning (DCP) created Community District Tabulation Areas (CDTAs) to closely approximate the 59 Community Districts of New York City for the purpose of reporting American Community Survey (ACS) data. You can find the data [here](https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/census-download-metadata.page), or you can [download](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/dcp/assets/files/zip/data-tools/bytes/nycdta2020_24d.zip)

* Borough Boundaries data

The Borough Boundaries dataset from the NYC Open Data portal provides detailed information about the geographical boundaries of the five boroughs of New York City: Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. You can find the data [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm)

* Neighborhood data

[Here](https://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ny/new-york-city/2024-09-04/visualisations/neighbourhoods.csv) is neighbourhood list for geo filter. Sourced from city or open source GIS files. [Here](https://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ny/new-york-city/2024-09-04/visualisations/neighbourhoods.geojson) is GeoJSON file of neighbourhoods of the city.

* Education data

The data source for education is shown [here](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/social-conditions/?id=2334#display=summary).

The original [data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8/about_data) only consists of some basic information and doesnâ€™t show NTA, CDTA, Borough and neighborhood information of each incident, so we added these information to the original data base on the coordinate of each incident, we also add some demographic information: population, education level, poverty level, .etc to the data.

Here's how we added the information based on all the data we have:

data_final <- read_csv("data_final.csv")

```

```{r}
# Grouping the data by year to count the number of incidents
df_descriptive$Year <- as.factor(df_descriptive$Year)
year_counts <- as.data.frame(table(df_descriptive$Year))
colnames(year_counts) <- c('Year', 'Count')


# Plotting the line chart for shooting incidents by year with data points labeled
ggplot(year_counts, aes(x = Year, y = Count, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(color = 'blue') +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = Count), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +
  labs(title = 'Shooting Incidents by Year in NYC',
       x = 'Year',
       y = 'Number of Shooting Incidents') +
  theme_minimal()
```

The chart shows a stable trend in shooting incidents from 2017 to 2019, followed by a sharp increase in 2020, likely linked to socio-economic factors like the COVID-19 pandemic. Incidents peaked in 2021 and then declined through 2023.

```{r}
sky_dark_counts <- df_descriptive %>%
  group_by(Sky_Is_Dark) %>%
  summarise(total_incidents = n())

ggplot(sky_dark_counts, aes(x = Sky_Is_Dark, y = total_incidents, fill = Sky_Is_Dark)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("FALSE" = "Daytime", "TRUE" = "Nighttime")) + # Update x-axis labels
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("FALSE" = "skyblue", "TRUE" = "darkblue"),
                    labels = c("FALSE" = "Daytime", "TRUE" = "Nighttime")) +
  labs(title = 'Number of Shooting Incidents by time (Daytime vs. Nigttime)',
       x = 'Time of a day(Daytime vs. Nigttime)',
       y = 'Number of Shooting Incidents') +
  theme_minimal()
```

The number of shooting incidents when the sky was dark is significantly higher than when it was bright. This might indicate that shootings are more likely to occur during nighttime or low visibility conditions. The higher number of incidents during dark conditions could be due to factors such as reduced visibility, higher activity at night, or fewer people around, making it easier for incidents to occur undetected

       fill = "Victim Race") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The bar charts show the distribution of male and female shooting victims by age group and race in NYC. In both charts, Black victims are the most affected across all age groups, with the highest number of victims in the 18-24 and 25-44 age groups. For males, the 25-44 age group shows a notable peak, while for females, the same age group also has the highest numbers. White Hispanic victims also show considerable numbers, particularly in the 25-44 age group.

```{r}
# Plot: Bar chart showing victim's age
ggplot(df_descriptive %>% filter(!is.na(VIC_AGE_GROUP)& VIC_AGE_GROUP != 1022), aes(x = VIC_AGE_GROUP)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Bar Chart of Victim's Age",
       x = "Victim Age Group",
       y = "Count of Victims") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The 25-44 age group has the highest number of victims, significantly more than any other group. The 18-24 age group also shows a considerable number of victims, while the <18 and 45-64 age groups have notably fewer victims. The 65+ age group has the least number of victims.

The map shows the total number of incidents across NYC boroughs (2017â€“2023), with each borough represented by a distinct color. A gradient is used to indicate the magnitude of incidents, with darker shades corresponding to higher counts, ranging from 0 to over 3,000 incidents. Each borough is outlined and filled with its respective color, making it easy to distinguish. The legend on the right identifies the boroughs (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island) and aligns with the color gradient to show the number of incidents.

The Bronx demonstrates significant variability in the number of incidents across its CDTAs, with central and southern regions experiencing the highest numbers of incidents, some exceeding 300. This highlights the borough as a hotspot for crime relative to others. Socioeconomic challenges, high population density, or structural inequities could contribute to these trends. Interventions should prioritize these high-incident areas by allocating additional law enforcement resources and community support programs to mitigate the causes of elevated crime levels.

Manhattan shows a relatively low overall number of incidents, except for a few northern neighborhoods, where one CDTA is a clear outlier with incidents surpassing 1200. This disparity suggests a concentration of crime in specific areas rather than borough-wide. The localized nature of the issue could be due to unique socioeconomic pressures or demographic factors in those neighborhoods. Targeted initiatives such as community policing or economic investment in northern Manhattan could help address these localized hotspots.

Queens generally exhibits a safer profile with most CDTAs reporting fewer than 100 incidents. However, one central area stands out with more than 400 incidents, marking it as a concern. The low number of incidents elsewhere reflects the suburban and less dense nature of the borough. Efforts in Queens should focus on analyzing the central hotspot to determine the underlying causes, such as potential economic or social stressors, and implementing programs to improve community safety.

Brooklyn presents a widespread distribution of incidents, with several CDTAs exceeding 500 incidents. The borough shows higher overall numbers compared to Queens and Manhattan, which may be linked to its high population density and mixed socioeconomic profile. The more even distribution of incidents suggests a need for borough-wide interventions rather than focusing on isolated areas. A combination of public safety initiatives, housing improvements, and community programs would be essential for addressing crime across the borough.

Staten Island stands out with the lowest number of incidents among the five boroughs. Most CDTAs report fewer than 50 incidents, with one area as an exception, exceeding 200 incidents. This aligns with Staten Island's suburban and less densely populated character, which likely contributes to its lower crime rates. Maintaining this safety level requires continued focus on community engagement and ensuring sufficient resources are available to address any emerging hotspots.

## Statistical analysis
## Method for Calculating Correlation Coefficients
To assess potential linear relationships between socioeconomic variables and shooting rates, correlation coefficients were calculated. Specifically, the relationship between poverty rates and shooting rates, as well as between the percentage of high school graduates and shooting rates, was explored across different neighborhoods in NYC.

### Poverty

Calculate the correlation between the poverty percentage and the incident rate.
```{r}
correlation <- cor(data_clean$incident_rate_by_year_nta, data_clean$Percent_poverty, use = "complete.obs")
print(paste("Correlation coefficient: ", correlation))
```

```{r}

data_clean %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~Percent_poverty, y = ~incident_rate_by_year_nta, 
          color = ~NTA, colors = "viridis", 
          type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
          text = ~paste("Neighborhood: ", NTA, "<br>Borough: ", BORO, 
                        "<br>% Below Poverty Line: ", Percent_poverty, 
                        "<br>Incident Rate: ", incident_rate_by_year_nta)) %>%
  layout(title = "Percent Below the Poverty Line and Incident Rate in NYC",
         xaxis = list(title = 'Percentage of People Whose Income is Below the Poverty Line'),
         yaxis = list(title = 'Incident Rate'),
         legend = list(title = list(text = 'Neighborhood')))
```
```{r}
# Scatter plot for Brooklyn
data_clean |> 
  filter(neighbourhood_group == "Brooklyn") |> 
  plot_ly(data = _, x = ~Percent_poverty, y = ~incident_rate_by_year_nta, 
          color = ~NTA,
          colors = "plasma", 
          type = "scatter",
          mode = "markers",
          text = ~paste("Neighborhood: ", NTA, "<br>Borough: ", neighbourhood_group, 
                        "<br>% Below Poverty Line: ", Percent_poverty, 
                        "<br>Incident Rate: ", incident_rate_by_year_nta)) |> 
    layout(title = "Percent Below the Poverty Line and Incident Rate in Brooklyn",
           xaxis = list(title = 'Percentage of People Whose Income is Below the Poverty Line'),

          color = ~NTA,
          colors = "inferno", 
          type = "scatter",
          mode = "markers",
          text = ~paste("Neighborhood: ", NTA, "<br>Borough: ", neighbourhood_group, 
                        "<br>% Below Poverty Line: ", Percent_poverty, 
                        "<br>Incident Rate: ", incident_rate_by_year_nta)) |>

           yaxis = list(title = 'Incident Rate'),
           legend = list(title = list(text = 'Neighborhood')))

```

* Across all neighborhoods in NYC, there is a moderate positive linear relationship between the percentage of people below the poverty line (Percent_poverty) and the incident rate by neighborhood (incident_rate_by_year_nta).(r = 0.508).
* Associations differ by borough.
* Notably, Brooklyn (0.5686) and Staten Island (0.5576) show the highest correlations, suggesting that the relationship between poverty and incident rate is stronger in these boroughs.

## Discussion
In conclusion,our exploratory analyses reveals key insights into the distribution of shooting incidents in New York City, their incident rates, and their relationship with sociodemographic factors, particularly poverty and education levels. This research will aid in informing targeted public health and safety interventions by identifying the communities most impacted by shootings. Further discussion of our results for specific analyses are below.

### Shooting Incident Distribution

The spatial distribution of shooting incidents in NYC shows notable concentration in certain Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs), particularly in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. Specifically, neighborhoods like Mott Haven-Port Morris in the Bronx and Brownsville in Brooklyn show consistently high rates of shooting incidents. Staten Island, by comparison, shows lower rates of shooting incidents, although neighborhoods like St. George-New Brighton are more heavily impacted within the borough.

The temporal analysis also highlights a spike in incidents during 2020, likely linked to socio-economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This peak was followed by a decline through 2023, suggesting that some return to normality or enhanced public safety measures may have played a role in the reduction of shootings. Furthermore, incidents are more prevalent during periods of darkness, which might reflect reduced visibility, fewer people around, and greater opportunities for undetected actions.

### Incident Rates and Sociodemographic Correlation

The analysis of incident rates in different NTAs and their correlation with sociodemographic factors reveals several important trends:

#### Poverty and Shooting Rates: 
The correlation between poverty levels and shooting rates is moderately positive (r = 0.508), indicating that neighborhoods with higher poverty levels tend to have more shooting incidents. This pattern was particularly strong in Brooklyn (0.5686) and Staten Island (0.5576), suggesting that economic hardships might exacerbate vulnerability to gun violence in these areas.

#### Education and Shooting Rates: 
The analysis showed a negative correlation (-0.2748) between high school graduation rates and shooting incidents, implying that neighborhoods with higher educational attainment tend to experience fewer shootings. Notably, the relationship was strongest in The Bronx (0.3996) and Staten Island (-0.6452), where increased high school graduation rates are associated with a marked decrease in shooting incidents. However, this trend was less evident in Manhattan, suggesting that factors beyond education may be more influential in certain areas.

### Sociodemographic Impact

Our findings suggest that socio-economic conditions play a substantial role in the spatial and temporal distribution of shootings in NYC. Neighborhoods with lower educational attainment and higher poverty rates are disproportionately impacted by gun violence. This highlights the importance of targeted interventions focused on improving socio-economic conditions, particularly education and employment opportunities, as means of mitigating gun violence.

The disparity among boroughs also suggests that local contexts and community-specific dynamics are key in understanding gun violence. For example, while poverty was a significant factor across the city, its impact varied, with Staten Island and Brooklyn showing a stronger relationship with shooting rates. Similarly, education had a stronger protective effect in Staten Island and the Bronx.

## Limitations
While this study provides an initial exploration of shooting patterns and their relationship to sociodemographic factors, there are several limitations. First, the use of correlational analysis means that we cannot establish causation. Furthermore, we may have missed important confounders, such as policing practices or the presence of gang activity, which could influence shooting incidents. Future studies should incorporate these factors and explore causal relationships, possibly using more advanced statistical methods, such as multilevel models or causal inference techniques.
