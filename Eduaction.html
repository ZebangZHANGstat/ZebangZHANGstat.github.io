<p>For neighborhoods with a high percentage of high school graduates
(90% and above), incident rates are generally low, often below 0.05.
This suggests that higher educational attainment may be associated with
fewer incidents</p>

<li><p>Manhattan: -0.2284</p></li>
<li><p>There is a weak negative correlation between high school
graduation rates and incident rates in Manhattan. This suggests that as
the percentage of high school graduates increases, the incident rate
tends to decrease slightly.</p></li>
<li><p>Brooklyn: -0.2487</p></li>
<li><p>Brooklyn also shows a weak negative correlation. The trend is
similar to Manhattan, where higher graduation rates are associated with
slightly lower incident rates.</p></li>
<li><p>Bronx: -0.3996</p></li>
<li><p>The Bronx has a moderate negative correlation between graduation
rates and incident rates. This suggests a stronger relationship compared
to Manhattan and Brooklyn, indicating that in the Bronx, neighborhoods
with higher percentages of high school graduates are more likely to have
lower incident rates.</p></li>
<li><p>Staten Island: -0.6452</p></li>
<li><p>Staten Island has a strong negative correlation between high
school graduation rates and incident rates.</p></li>
<li><p>Queens: 0.1007</p></li>
<li><p>Queens shows a weak positive correlation. Unlike the other
boroughs, this suggests that in Queens, neighborhoods with higher
graduation rates may have slightly higher incident rates, but this
relationship is very weak. ### Manhattan</p></li>

<p>There is no clear linear trend between high school graduation rates
and incident rates in Manhattan. The distribution of points suggests a
weak negative correlation overall.East Harlem (North and South) and
Chinatown-Two Bridges appear to have both lower high school graduation
rates and higher incident rates. This suggests that in these
neighborhoods, lower educational attainment may be correlated with
higher vulnerability.</p>
